/*
**Description**

This resource is used to provision and manage an instance of the Business Connectivity Services Service Application.
It will identify an instance of the BCS app through the application display name.
Currently the resource will provision the app if it does not yet exist, and will change the service account associated to the app if it does not match the configuration.
Database names or server name will not be changed if the configuration does not match, these parameters are only used for the initial provisioning of the service application.

**Example**

    SPBCSServiceApp BCSServiceApp
    {
        Name            = "BCS Service Application"
        ApplicationPool = "SharePoint Service Applications"
        DatabaseName    = "SP_BCS"
        DatabaseServer  = $DatabaseServer
        InstallAccount  = $InstallAccount
        Ensure          = "Present"
    }
