**Description**

This resource is used to make sure that a specific feature is either enabled or disabled at a given URL/scope.

The name property is the name of the feature based on its folder name in the FEATURES folder in the SharePoint hive directory.

    {
        Name                 = "ViewFormPagesLockDown"
        Url                  = "http://www.contoso.com"
        Ensure               = "Present"
