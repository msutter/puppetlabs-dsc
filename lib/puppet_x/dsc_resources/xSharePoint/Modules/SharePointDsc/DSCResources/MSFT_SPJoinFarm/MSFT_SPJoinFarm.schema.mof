/*
**Description**

This resource will be responsible for joining a server to an existing SharePoint farm.
To create a new farm use the [SPCreateFarm](SPCreateFarm) resource on a different server to begin with, and then pass the same database server and configuration database name parameters to the additional servers using this resource.
After the server has joined the farm, the process will wait for 5 minutes to allow farm specific configuration to take place on the server, before allowing further DSC configuration to take place.

**Example**

    SPJoinFarm JoinSPFarm
    {
        DatabaseServer           = $DatabaseServer
        FarmConfigDatabaseName   = "SP_Config"
        Passphrase               = $FarmPassPhrase
        PsDscRunAsCredential     = $InstallAccount
    }
